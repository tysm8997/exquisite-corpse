       <h1> Hello from Jackie and Hudson and Tyler and Kim!</h1>

       <p>Who is ready for a taco tuezday PARTY <br> <b>[Taco's]</b>  We are!</p>



       <p>Imagine being something warm, salty, savory, and wonderful. A crispy, somewhat smooth, crunchy outer layer, and a saucy, meaty, flavorful inside. Well, that is what our story is all about. The wonderful world of...tacos. Ortega was a lonely shell, with no one to fill his heart. He was on the dry foods side of the Mexican section in the store, while all of the other softies were on the opposite side, unable to reach each other. He thought about Tia Rosa all the time. She had a gorgeous golden brown color, and soft, squishy features. All he wantd was to be next to her, but there was no way they could survive that jump from the opposite side of the aisle. Ortega's ultimate mission was to get over to Tia Rosa and run away together to the meat section and drench themselves in Lawry's so they can literally fill themselves with happiness.</p>
